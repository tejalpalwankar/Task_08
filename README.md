# Task_08_Bias_Detection  
### Phase 1 – Week 1 (Experimental Design)  

---

## Overview
This week focuses on planning the bias-detection experiment before any model runs.  
The study builds on earlier work validating the **Syracuse Women’s Lacrosse 2025** dataset and explores how **prompt framing and context** influence LLM-generated analyses.

---

## Week 1 Progress
- Defined four testable hypotheses covering framing, demographic, confirmation, and sentiment bias.  
- Designed paired prompts that vary only one linguistic element at a time.  
- Documented the experimental setup, ground-truth references, and ethical safeguards in `Research_task-08.docx`.  

---

## Next Steps
1. Implement and run `experiment_design.py` and `run_experiment.py` to collect LLM responses.  
2. Log outputs, analyze tone and mention patterns, and compare across GPT-4, Claude 3, and Gemini 1.5.  
3. Compile bias findings into the final `REPORT.md` for submission.

## Notes
- All player data are anonymized.  
- Ground-truth stats verified from previous Python analyses.
